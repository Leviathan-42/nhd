            <h3>Breaking Barriers
            </h3>
            <p>Nellie Bly revolutionized journalism by becoming one of the first female investigative reporters in an era when women were largely excluded from newsrooms (Baker, 102). She challenged the traditional roles assigned to women in the 1880s, proving that female journalists could tackle serious subjects and dangerous assignments.
            </p>
            <p>Her bold entry into a male-dominated field opened doors for future generations of women in journalism and demonstrated that gender should not limit professional aspirations.

            <h3>Undercover Reporting
            </h3>
            <p>She pioneered immersive journalism techniques, going undercover to expose injustices firsthand (Sloan, 71). This revolutionary approach to reporting involved personally experiencing the conditions she wrote about, rather than simply interviewing sources or observing from a distance (Sloan, 73).
            </p>
            <p>Her willingness to risk her own safety and comfort to uncover the truth set a new standard for investigative journalism that continues to influence reporters today.

            <h3>Around the World
            </h3>
            <p>Her 72-day journey around the world in 1889-1890 broke records and challenged perceptions of what women could achieve (Goodman, 298). This feat not only beat Jules Verne's fictional record but also demonstrated women's capability for independent travel and adventure.
            </p>
            <p>The journey captured international attention and proved that women could accomplish extraordinary feats of endurance and determination (Goodman, 315).

              <h3>New Methods of Reporting
              </h3>
              <p>Nellie Bly's approach to journalism was revolutionary in several ways:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Immersive Reporting:</strong> She lived the stories she wrote, experiencing conditions firsthand
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social Justice Focus:</strong> Her work consistently highlighted injustices and advocated for the powerless
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Narrative Style:</strong> She wrote in an engaging, story-driven format that made serious issues accessible to the general public
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Evidence-Based Reporting:</strong> She gathered concrete evidence and documentation to support her expos√©s
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

          <h3>Breaking Gender Barriers
          </h3>
          <p>In the 1880s, women journalists were typically relegated to writing about fashion, society events, or domestic topics. Nellie Bly shattered these limitations by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Taking on dangerous investigative assignments
            </li>
            <li>Traveling alone to foreign countries
            </li>
            <li>Exposing serious social issues
            </li>
            <li>Commanding the same respect and wages as male colleagues
            </li>
          </ul>
