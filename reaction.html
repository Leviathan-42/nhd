            <p>The public reaction was swift and intense. Readers were horrified by the conditions she described, and her vivid, first-person accounts made the suffering of asylum patients impossible to ignore.

              </h3>
              <p>City officials were initially defensive about Bly's asylum exposé, but public pressure forced them to take action. A grand jury was convened to investigate the conditions at Blackwell's Island (Grand Jury Report on Blackwell's Island Asylum, October 1887).
              </p>
              <p>The investigation confirmed many of Bly's findings and led to significant policy changes and increased funding for mental health care (New York City Department of Public Charities and Correction Annual Report, 1888).
